This repository works towards question 25 for Compound bounties on the webpage https://www.notion.so/Analytics-Bounties-for-Alchemix-ffd6c25bdef3486c9b8dfa9476ac6a39. With this question, we are interested in understanding how much value is being taken out of farming pools every day, who the largest withdrawers are, and where they are going. We conduct our study using Flipside Crypto data.

Our solution is located in a jupyter notebook.

We have included multiple ways to view the report:

FarmingPoolDepartures.ipynb --> This is a jupyter notebook. The code can be actually run in here by execting "jupyter notebook FarmingPoolDepartures.ipynb" in terminal from this directory.

FarmingPoolDepartures.pdf --> This is an exported PDF document of the write-up and code included in the jupyter notebook. This also includes the graphs that the code generates.
